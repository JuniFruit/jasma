## The Purpose of JASMA

In the interest of fostering a learning environment for developers of all experience levels, the purpose of JASMA, has been established to meet the following six points:

### 1. Dedicated Learning

The goal of Jasma is to facilitate the acquisition of new skills, which can extend beyond web development to other areas such as devops, UI/graphics design, data science, cybersecurity, AI, project management, systems design, marketing, and more.
The dedicated aspect of this learning means that it is intended to achieve practical goals that can be applied in production projects.

### 2. Collaboration

Collaboration is an important component of the learning process, and it is especially relevant to software development, which relies heavily on communication and teamwork to produce a functioning system.
Multiple perspectives on a given problem can be useful in identifying the best solutions, and collaboration can inspire motivation and support within the group.
It is important to maintain a blameless culture, in which members work together to solve problems without assigning blame.

### 3. Creativity

Creativity is an essential part of learning and can serve as an inspiration for further learning opportunities.
JASMA encourages creative thinking and experimentation, allowing members to add novel features to the project that may be experimental, unconventional, or innovative.
For example, custom colors, fonts, and page/post customizations were discussed as potential features, as well as the ability to write posts in markup.

### 4. Mentorship and Guidance

Mentorship and guidance can help accelerate the learning process and make it more enjoyable.
Members can benefit from having a mentor or guide who can provide answers to their questions and help steer them in the right direction.
Mentorship does not necessarily imply that the mentor is more experienced, but rather that they have a different perspective to offer.

### 5. Challenging and Inspiring

Learning to create a social media platform or any large software project is a difficult and challenging task.
JASMA aims to challenge its members and inspire them to develop their skills with confidence.
Breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps and learning from mistakes is an important part of the learning process.

### 6. Fair Compensation

In the event that JASMA gains a significant user base and generates revenue beyond operational costs, fair compensation for active members will be considered.
This compensation could include educational resources such as CodeCademy subscriptions, Coursera, Udemy, Google courses, certificates, books, and other resources that foster learning opportunities.
